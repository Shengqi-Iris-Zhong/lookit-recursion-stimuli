# Consent to participate in research: [`Language and pattern learning in infants`]

Researchers led by [`Dr. Kathryn Schuler`] at [`the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania`] are running this study, "[`Language and pattern learning in infants`]," on Lookit.

## Purpose

[`purpose`: We are studying how infants and children learn languages and the ways in which their ability to do so changes with age. ]

## Procedures

This study takes about [`15 minutes`] to complete. [`procedures`: With your consent, your baby will first listen to audio recordings for approximately 6 minutes in which they will be exposed to a real or made-up language or pattern.  During the testing phase, your baby will then hear another series of audio recordings consistent or inconsistent with the previous language pattern. We will measure you baby's looking time in the testing trials. Your baby's session will be recorded.]

## Participation

You and your baby are free to choose whether to be in this study. If you and your baby choose to participate, it's okay to stop at any point during the session. Please pause or stop the session if your baby becomes very fussy or does not want to participate! 

## Risks

[`risks`: No known risks are associated with this study other than the potential for mild boredom. We minimize this risk by making our studies as engaging as possible so that they are fun for most children. ]

## Benefits

[`Benefits`: Participating in this study will not benefit you or your child directly. You and your child may enjoy contributing to the study of language and cognitive science. ]

## Compensation

Typically we would give your child a book as a thank you for participating in our study. Due to the remote nature of this research, we are providing parents with a $5 gift card as an alternative. 

## Data collection and webcam recording

During the session, you and your child will be recorded via your computer's webcam and microphone. Video recordings and other data you enter are sent securely to the Lookit platform and stored indefinitely. At the end of the session, you will be prompted to choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings. You will have the option to withdraw your video data at this point. You can view your past recordings on Lookit under "Studies" -> "Your past studies" at any time.

Data is stored securely on Lookit servers and by researchers. However, there is always a small risk that data transmitted over the internet may be intercepted or that the security of stored data may be compromised.

No video clips will be published or shared unless you allow this when selecting a privacy level. If we do not receive a consent recording (the video you'll make to the right) for this session and cannot verify that you agreed to participate, no other video from your session will be viewed.

## Use of data by study researchers

The research group led by [`Dr. Kathryn Schuler`] at [`the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania`] will have access to video and other data collected during this session. We will also have access to your account profile, demographic survey, and the child profile for the child who is participating, including changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may study your child's responses in connection with his or her previous responses to this or other studies run by our group, siblings' responses to this or other studies run by our group, or demographic survey responses.

[`datause`: We may share your baby’s anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your child’s name and date of birth will never be associated with any data that is shared. The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your baby’s name, date of birth, or any other personal identifying information.]

## Use of data by Lookit 

Because this study is being run on the Lookit platform, researchers working on the Lookit project at MIT will also have access to the data collected during this session, in addition to your account data, child profiles, and demographic survey responses. This data may be used by Lookit to detect and fix technical problems or identify new features that would be helpful; provide support to study researchers; assess data quality (for instance, how well an observer can tell which direction children are looking); evaluate the site's success in reaching a diverse population; and characterize family engagement (for instance, looking at what aspects of a study make parents more interested in coming back later).

## Publication of results

The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Raw data (for instance, looking times to the left and right of the screen) may be published when it cannot identify babies. We never publish babies' birthdates or names, and we never publish your demographic data in conjunction with your baby's video.


## Rights of research subjects

[`research_rights_statement`: Participation in this study is entirely **voluntary** for both you and your baby. You may decline to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences. If you have questions about the study, please contact Kathryn Schuler at 215-898-6909. If you have questions about your child’s rights as a research participant, you may also contact the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the University of Pennsylvania at 215-898-2614.]


## Researcher contact information

This study is run by [`Dr. Kathryn Schuler`] at [`the University of Pennsylvania`].  If you or your child have any questions or concerns about this study, or in the very unlikely event of a research-related injury, please contact [`215-898-6909`]. 

If you or your child have any questions or concerns about the Lookit platform, please contact Kim Scott at kimscott@mit.edu or 617 324 4859.
